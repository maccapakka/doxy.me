# Cursor Rules Maintenance

The `.cursor/rules/` directory contains project conventions that guide AI assistance. **These rules must stay current with the project.**

## When to Update Rules

Update the relevant `.mdc` file when:

1. **Adding/removing npm scripts** - Update the scripts table in `monorepo.mdc`
2. **Adding new workspaces** - Update the workspace table in `pnpm.mdc`
3. **Discovering pnpm quirks** - Add to "Known Quirks" section in `pnpm.mdc`
4. **Changing tooling** - Update the code quality stack in `monorepo.mdc`
5. **New conventions established** - Document in the appropriate rule file

## How to Update

When making a change that affects conventions:

1. Identify which rule file is affected
2. Update the relevant section
3. Keep formatting consistent (tables, headers, etc.)
4. Be concise - rules should be scannable, not verbose

## Rule Files Overview

| File | Purpose | Update When |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `pnpm.mdc` | Dependency management | New workspaces, pnpm issues, install patterns |
| `monorepo.mdc` | Project structure/conventions | Scripts, tooling, structure changes |
| `cursor-rules.mdc` | This file - meta rules | New rule files added |

## Creating New Rule Files

If a new domain of conventions emerges (e.g., testing, deployment), create a new `.mdc` file:

1. Create `.cursor/rules/<domain>.mdc`
2. Add frontmatter with `description` and `alwaysApply: true`
3. Document the conventions clearly
4. Update this file's table above
